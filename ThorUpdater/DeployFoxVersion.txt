# DeployFox

DeployFox automates the steps required to deploy your applications by providing a customizable list of tasks: copy files, rename files, build a project into an EXE, digitally sign an EXE, run an Inno Setup script to create an installer, upload files to an FTP site, and so on.

## Releases

### 2024-10-09

* UploadFile and DownloadFile tasks no longer output the user name and password to the log file.

* The log file is no longer opened in the background on Windows 10 machines (issue #2). Note: this is actually a change in OpenFile.prg, which is part of [VFPX Framework](https://github.com/VFPX/VFPXFramework). Thanks to Joel Leach for the fix.

* FoxCryptoNG.prg was renamed to DeployFoxEncryption.prg to prevent conflict building projects that contained that program.

### 2024-08-30

* Added a Home Page link to the DeployFox dialog.

* Added a Clone Task function.

* Added a *Wait until done* setting to RunEXE and ExecutePSScript tasks.

* Implemented VFPX Framework 2024-08-30.

### 2024-08-18

* Added the $ProjectPath built-in variable.

* Fixed issues with the BuildSetupInno task.

* Added the Test Project folder with a test project.

* Renamed SFMenu.vcx to VFPXMenu.vcx to prevent problems building an EXE containing SFMenu.vcx (issue #1).
